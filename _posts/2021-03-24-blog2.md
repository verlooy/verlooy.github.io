## Purple Fox 

[Guardicore](guardicore.com) Posted a blog about a new worm called Purple Fox that has received lots of attention lately because of the growning numbers of infected computers. In the past it was using exploit kids or phising emails, now it is using the service called SMB which stands for Server Message Block which is used for file sharing. They are spraying the network looking for internet facing computers and brute forcing the password. Most servers compromised appear to be using Microsoft IIS 7.5.

The payload is executed through a vulnerability in SMB or email which uses a vulnerability within a browser. After the execution, the payload will download the MSI through a list of URLs.
